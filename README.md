My solutions to exercises in HackerRank.com, vaguely organized by problem domain.

Some Hacker Rank problems did not allow Python 3 submissions (at the time I worked on them). This is noted within the top comment block for the relevant problems. For those, I solved in Python 3 first and then submitted a Java translation.

A few rare files were not actually HR submissions in themselves, but they ended up being used as building blocks to solve another, more difficult problem. This is also noted within the top comment block of the relevant files.
